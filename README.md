# NovelAIDiffusion-API

### Prerequisites
- Image sequences, standard videos made from the former, and cluster collages require a functional Python 3 installation and the following packages easily installable via PIP: requests, pillow, numpy, opencv-python
- Optional: Interpolating videos requires a Flowframes installation and a correctly configured path in NAID_User_Config.py

### Usage
Set up python and the dependencies as mentioned above.  
Clone/download the files from this repository to your preferred folder.
Once you have the folder set up with the files, first, run GenerationZone.py once. It will generate a file called NAID_User_Config.py which you can edit freely. Get your NAI access token and put it in there in the sample format. It will need to be refreshed every 30 days.  
Then open GenerationZone.py, ideally in a proper text/code editor of your choice, read the explanations and familiarize yourself with the examples.  
When you're ready, configure your settings according to what you'd like to generate and use one of the according functions, then run GenerationZone.py, rinse and repeat. The settings will be automatically saved alongside generations and can be copied from the according files, so you can keep GenerationZone.py clean at all times.

This tool is and will remain completely free to use, but if you could spare a bit of support that would be appreciated: https://www.patreon.com/Xovaryu (mild NSFW/18+ warning)  
I also have a discord server where I organize all my AI image generation endeavors including using this and other tools to try and gain a deeper understanding for certain characteristics of NAID, where we can share our results and so on: https://discord.gg/xJTwDVBa5b (again, NSFW/18+ warning)
