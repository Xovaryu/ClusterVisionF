### Prerequisites
Only a functional Python (3) installation should be needed for image sequences. For videos and cluster collages, install OpenCV via PIP. To automatically create interpolated videos Flowframes can also be used.

### Usage

Then open GenerationZone.py, read the explanations and familiarize yourself with the examples.
When you're ready, configure your settings according to what you'd like to generate and use one of the according functions, then run GenerationZone.py, rinse and repeat. The settings will be automatically saved alongside generations and can be copied from the according files.
