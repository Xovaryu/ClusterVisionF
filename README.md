# NovelAIDiffusion-API

### Prerequisites
- Image sequences, standard videos made from the former, and cluster collages require a functional Python 3 installation and the following packages easily installable via PIP: requests, pillow, numpy, opencv-python
- Interpolating videos also requires a Flowframes installation and a correctly configured path in NAID_Config.py

### Usage
First, get your NAI access token and put it into NAID_Config.py, it will need to be refreshed every 30 days.
Then open GenerationZone.py, read the explanations and familiarize yourself with the examples.
When you're ready, configure your settings according to what you'd like to generate and use one of the according functions, then run GenerationZone.py, rinse and repeat. The settings will be automatically saved alongside generations and can be copied from the according files.
